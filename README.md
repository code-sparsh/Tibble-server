# Tibble-server

## Tibble
Tibble is your offline privacy-focussed AI assistant tool, which works totally without Internet.

<summary><b>Problems Tibble solves</b></summary>

Companies around the world are expanding their dependency on AI based tools but they are also worried about the villain of this story and that villain is none other than giants like OpenAI and Microsoft. Corporate customers do not like to share their internal data with third party platforms for their privacy concerns and that's where Private LLMs come in.


We solve this problem of privacy by offering these companies a way for them to install an on-site AI model inference server fine-tuned on their own private data.
